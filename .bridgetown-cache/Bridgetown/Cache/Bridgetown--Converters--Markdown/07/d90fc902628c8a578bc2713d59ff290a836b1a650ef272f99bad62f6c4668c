<p>Feedbacks are important to us and we do our best to make you feel heard.
We know that accessing nested properties is a pain point for many of you so we tried to make the navigation clearer and the selected element will now stand out more.</p>

<p>Weâ€™d love to hear from you and see if these changes suit your needs so hit us up with <a href="mailto:hello@bump.sh">your comments</a> whether you love it or hate it!</p>
