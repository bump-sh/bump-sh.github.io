<p>// Work in Progress</p>

<p>Bump allows you to generate your API documentation and API changelog quickly.</p>

<h2 id="specifications">Specifications</h2>
<p>Bump.sh supports OpenAPI or AsyncAPI specification: you can deploy your API documentation in a few minutes.</p>

<h2 id="customization">Customization</h2>
<p>Custom domains, branding, colors, branching, Markdown support‚Ä¶ you name it: Bump.sh offers many possibilities to make your documentation truly yours.</p>

<h2 id="track-changes">Track changes</h2>
<p>Share a link to your documentation with your API consumers and help them never miss an API change again. They can track API structural changes if they subscribe by email. Once a week, subscribers will receive a changelog digest of your documentation if your API has changed.</p>

<h2 id="cli-and-integration">CLI and Integration</h2>
<p>We suggest integrating our tool into your development process to make the most out of Bump. We offer a Command Line Interface and Continuous Integration examples to let you: view API diff during code review thanks to our GitHub Action, Bump will automatically comment on your pull requests with changes digest, then once merged we will deploy your changes directly your documentation page.</p>

<h2 id="hubs-and-collaboration">Hubs and Collaboration</h2>
<p>If you work in a multiple services environment and have many different APIs, we got you covered. You can organize and mix your OpenAPI and AsyncAPI-based documentation, in a developer Hub. You will thus have all of your APIs listed in one place.
Work with your team and partners through Organizations and use our Access Management to check who can access what.</p>
