I"€<p>As your API grows, your specification becomes more and more complex. At some point, splitting it up into multiple files with <code class="highlighter-rouge">$ref</code> references pointing to these external resources can help a lot.</p>

<p>We have just released full external references support  by updating:</p>
<ul>
  <li>our web app</li>
  <li>our CLI (<a href="https://github.com/bump-sh/bump-cli/releases/tag/v0.7.0">version 0.7 is out</a>)</li>
  <li>our GitHub action (<a href="https://github.com/marketplace/actions/api-documentation-on-bump">version 0.2 is out</a>)</li>
</ul>

<p>Now, no matter the channel you use to deploy a specification, Bump will resolve all references (when possible) and import their content into your documentation.</p>
