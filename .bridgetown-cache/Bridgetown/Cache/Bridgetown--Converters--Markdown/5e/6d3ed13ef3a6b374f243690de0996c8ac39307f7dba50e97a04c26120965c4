<p>Bump.sh supports Single Sign-On through your Identity and Access Management systems, to ease who in your organization can access admin permissions.</p>

<p>Our Single Sign-On feature relies on WorkOS, which supports a <a href="https://workos.com/docs/integrations">wide variety of integrations</a> with third-party Identity and Access Management solutions (e.g. generic SAML, SCIM, OpenID, as well as Auth0, Okta, Keycloak, Azure AD, Google SAML and more).</p>

<h2 id="activating-sso-for-your-organization">Activating SSO for your organization</h2>

<p>SSO is available on our <a href="https://bump.sh/pricing?utm_source=bump&amp;utm_medium=help_center">Business plans</a>.</p>

<p>Once you have purchased a Business plan, please <a href="mailto:hello@bump.sh">reach out to our support team</a> to have the feature activated on your account.</p>

<p>We will send you a URL that will let you complete the configuration, picking the Identity and Access Management solution you need.</p>

<h2 id="configuring-user-permissions">Configuring user permissions</h2>

<p>By default, all users who get access to Bump.sh via the configured SSO will have the <a href="../#member-management">“Viewer” Role/Permission</a>.</p>

<p>The Organization Owner may <a href="../#member-management">configure different permission levels</a> for each user via the Bump.sh administration user interface.</p>
