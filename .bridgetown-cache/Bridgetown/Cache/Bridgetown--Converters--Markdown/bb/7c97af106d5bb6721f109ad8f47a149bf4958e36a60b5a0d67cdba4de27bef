I"Ž<p>If some changes are more important than others, it is especially true for your API.</p>

<p>From now on, we automatically detect if a new version of your API includes some breaking changes. It will be visible in theÂ <a href="https://developers.bump.sh/changes">changelog page</a>, in theÂ changelog email or the brand new RSS feedâ€¦ but also during your API design phase while opening a pull request thanks toÂ <a href="https://github.com/bump-sh/github-action/">our Github Action</a>.</p>

<p>With Bump, you will never miss a <em>breaking</em> change again.</p>
