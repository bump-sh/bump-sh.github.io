I"m<p>Our <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/bump-cli#bump-diff-file">new bump <code class="highlighter-rouge">diff</code> command</a> has landed in our CLI. <br />
<em>Make sure to <a href="https://github.com/bump-sh/cli/releases/tag/v2.1.0">upgrade your <code class="highlighter-rouge">bump-cli</code> package</a> to at least <code class="highlighter-rouge">v2.1.0</code> to test it.</em></p>

<p>Now, straight from your CLI, you are able to describe the changes made in your contract:</p>

<div class="language-sh highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="o">&gt;</span> bump diff <span class="nt">--doc</span> users-account api-specification.yaml
Updated: GET /account
  Response modified: 200
    Body attribute added: ticket_ids
Added: GET /tickets/<span class="o">{</span>ticket_id<span class="o">}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The new command will output a quick summary of what has changed between your latest deployed API contract and the file you have changed locally.</p>

<p>If you use Github Actions to launch your automation workflows, we have some more good news for you: <a href="https://github.com/bump-sh/github-action/releases/tag/v1.0.0">we now offer a stable <code class="highlighter-rouge">bump-sh/github-action@v1</code> action</a>. And this latest release includes <strong>automatic API contract changelog pushed as a comment for each pull request</strong>.</p>
