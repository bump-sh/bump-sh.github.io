<p>Access management has been reshaped, thanks to extended tests and user feedback.</p>

<p>Inviting external customers and partners to access internal APIs is now possible directly from the dashboard.</p>

<p>From the dedicated section in your hub/documentation settings, you can quickly modify who has access to what. Open it to teammates of your organization, or invite external partners by email directly.</p>

<p>Password-protected level will stay available for a limited amount of time. More info can be found in our <a href="https://docs.bump.sh/help/access-management/">help center</a>.</p>
