I",<p>Building the best APIs can be a considerable amount of work and you may need your teammates to help. But you definitely do not want one single shared account for that.</p>

<p>Freshly out of beta, the awaited <strong>Organizations</strong> feature helps you with that. We did not reinvent the wheel but wanted to make it as simple but powerful as possible.</p>

<p><img src="/images/updates/organization-support.png" alt="organization-support.png" /></p>

<p>You can easily customize access with 3 different roles: admin, maintainer, and viewers.
Admins can invite and manage access, maintainers can manage hubs and docs, guests are limited to read-only.</p>

<p>Available from the Startup plan, we hope it will help teams work efficiently and smoothly on their APIs. You can find out more about Organizations in our <a href="https://docs.bump.sh/help/organizations/">Help Center</a>!</p>

<p>This update was also the opportunity to ship some enhancements for the dashboard.</p>

<p>We canâ€™t wait to hear about what you think of it so feel free to reach out!</p>
