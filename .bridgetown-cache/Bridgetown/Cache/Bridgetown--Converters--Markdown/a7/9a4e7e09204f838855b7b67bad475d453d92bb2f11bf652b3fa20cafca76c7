<p>We now identify deprecated elements in both OpenApi and AsyncApi specifications, and highlight them in your documentations.</p>

<p>We wanted to release it fast, as it was an important missing feature, but this is just the beginning: we have a lot of ideas on how we can enhance deprecation support that we will implement in the upcoming weeks.</p>
