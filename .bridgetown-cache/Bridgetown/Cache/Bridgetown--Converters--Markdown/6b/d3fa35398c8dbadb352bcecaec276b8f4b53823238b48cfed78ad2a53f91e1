<p>When we initially had the Bump idea, we though that it would be absolutely perfect to be able to handle any kind of documentation.</p>

<p>This said, at the moment, we are focusing on OpenAPI and AsyncAPI to offer the best support of these specifications.</p>

<h2 id="why-not-supporting-all-the-openapi-specification">Why not supporting all the OpenAPI specification?</h2>

<p>If you have tried Bump, you probably have already discovered that we don’t support the whole Swagger / OpenApi specification.</p>

<p>There are 2 reasons for that:</p>

<ul>
  <li>first, we are a fresh new project, which is far from being complete. So we may have decided to postpone some features due to our priorities.</li>
  <li>second, we may have decided that a specification feature adds too much complexity to the documentation, and have preferred to simply ignore it to keep things simple for now.</li>
</ul>

<p>Feel free to ask us why a feature you need is missing, we’ll be happy to answer and try to find a solution with you.</p>
