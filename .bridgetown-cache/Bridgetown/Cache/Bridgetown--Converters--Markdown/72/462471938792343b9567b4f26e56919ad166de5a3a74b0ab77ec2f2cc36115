I"ê<p>Introducing <strong>Branching</strong>, a great way to host several versions of an API Specification on the same documentation.</p>

<p>If your API has several versions you would like to maintain or if you are working between two environments, branching will make a difference and limit the number of documentation in your hub.</p>

<p>Create as many branches as you need, upload files accordingly and find the versions of your API anytime in your documentation, through a small selection menu.</p>

<p>Define which branch should be chosen by default, add or delete branches, keep everything up-to-date and share with your ecosystem the best API experience possible.</p>
