<p>Organizations are great when you need to work collaboratively with your team. Instead of a single shared account, each member of your team will be able to access/maintain your documentation and hubs.</p>

<p>Organizations are also super useful if you want to invite guests (who are called ‚Äúviewers‚Äù) to your documentation: it‚Äôs a read-only role. If you need to keep your API private or shared with a small number of partners, viewers are a great solution.</p>

<h2 id="create-a-new-organization">Create a new organization</h2>

<p>You can easily create an organization from your dashboard. Select the settings section and the organization tab. From here, you can create an organization or manage the ones you own.</p>

<p><img src="/images/help/organization-create.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Select ‚ÄúCreate Organization‚Äù to start a new one. You‚Äôll need to name it and choose its slug.</p>

<h2 id="member-management">Member management</h2>

<p>Once your organization is created, you may want to invite teammates and guests (which is the point, actually). When you invite a new member, you‚Äôll have to select a role before sending the invitation. Each role has its own permissions, detailed below. Roles can be modified at anytime.</p>

<p>Billing and invoice are only managed by the owner of the organization.</p>

<h2 id="organization-management">Organization management</h2>

<p>From your dashboard, you can manage the organizations you own and those you have admin role. Organization settings allow you to change its name and URL, transfer ownership to an active member or completely delete the organization.</p>

<p><img src="/images/help/organization-settings.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>:::caution
Transferring ownership is mandatory if you want to leave an organization. You can only transfer ownership to a member with admin role.
:::</p>

<p>:::caution
If you choose to close your Bump account but are still the owner of an organization, a warning message will be displayed. Please consider transferring ownership if necessary.
:::</p>

<p>:::danger
Deleting an organization will definitively erase its documentation and hubs. We <strong>cannot</strong> restore deleted content.
