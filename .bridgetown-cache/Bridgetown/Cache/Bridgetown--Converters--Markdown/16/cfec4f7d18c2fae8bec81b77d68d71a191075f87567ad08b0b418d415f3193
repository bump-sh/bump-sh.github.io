<p>This quick start guide is made for you, if you are actively writing OpenAPI or AsyncAPI files, or able to locate it in your code repository.</p>

<h3 id="step-1-create-your-spacedocumentation">Step 1: Create your space/documentation</h3>

<p>After creating your account, youâ€™ll be asked <a href="https://bump.sh/docs/new?utm_source=bump&amp;utm_medium=content_hub&amp;utm_campaign=getting_started">to create and name</a> your first API documentation.
By default, your documentation URL will use the same name: you can customize it in the slug field. You can also use <a href="custom-domains.md">custom domains</a>, which weâ€™ll explain later.</p>

<h3 id="step-2-upload-your-file">Step 2: Upload your file</h3>

<p>If you already have a specification file, you can immediately upload it.
You can also use our examples to see Bump.sh in action. Finally, our <a href="bump-cli.md">CLI</a> can also be directly used to jump in.</p>

<p>Generating your first documentation will take a few seconds. But letâ€™s not stop here: many features are awaiting to customize and make the most of your API documentation. Letâ€™s have a look in the next section.</p>

<h2 id="publish-your-documentation">Publish your documentation</h2>

<p>Congratulations on releasing your first API documentation on Bump.sh!</p>

<p>One of the first things you may have in mind is how to share your documentation with the world, your team or keep it for yourself.
Bump.sh offers several options to manage access to your documentation.
During the onboarding, you may have noticed the option of making your doc public or private.</p>

<p>Public documentation are available to anyone with the URL or if the search engine indexation has been activated.
Private ones are only accessible to you (or your team/organization if you have one).</p>

<p>We share more details on the <a href="access-management.md">Access Management page</a>.</p>

<h2 id="customization-options">Customization options</h2>

<p>With your documentation ready, you could want to make it more customized. Bump.sh offers several options to do so.</p>

<p>You can setup <a href="custom-domains.md">Custom Domains</a>, to make your doc available behind your own URL.
Several branding options are available: from your logo to <a href="meta-images.md">Meta Images</a> (that helps sharing your doc in a fancy way).
We also support <a href="doc-topics.md">Documentation Topics</a>, that helps you adding rich (con)text to your API doc, sharing the informations your community needs.</p>

<p><img src="/images/help/meta-image-2.png" alt="" /></p>

<h2 id="and-way-more">And way more</h2>

<p>We do not stop here. Feel free to browse this documentation or directly reach us to find out how to make the most of Bump.sh.
Thereâ€™s a lot more to cover: from Hubs that groups several API documentation to Branching, hosting several version of a same doc, youâ€™ll find many simple options that make a huge change.</p>

<p>The team is always here to listen if you have any feature requests or suggestions. We are here to help.</p>

<p><strong>We hope youâ€™ll enjoy using Bump.sh!</strong></p>
