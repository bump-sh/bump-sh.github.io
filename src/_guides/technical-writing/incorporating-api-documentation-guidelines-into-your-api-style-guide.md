excerpt: A look at the importance of incorporating API documentation best practices into your API style guide.
---

For many organizations, an API style guide is a well-established document. It outlines the conventions and patterns that developers should follow when building APIs. These guides typically cover topics like naming conventions for resources and parameters, request and response structures, and error handling. However, a crucial element often is missing: API documentation guidelines.

This article explores the importance of incorporating API documentation best practices into your API style guide. We'll explore the benefits, what to include in your guidelines, and conclude with an example you can use as a starting template for your own standards and practices.

## Why Documentation Guidelines Matter

Every developer writes API documentation in their own unique style. Some might be concise, others overly verbose. Some might lack crucial information, while others drown users with unnecessary details. In some cases, the documentation focuses more on the internal implementation details than how to consume the API. This inconsistency creates a frustrating experience for API consumers, hindering adoption and increasing support costs.
Here's how clear and consistent documentation guidelines benefit everyone:

**Improved Developer Experience:** Users can quickly grasp the API's capabilities and how to interact with it. Consistent formatting and structure make it easier to navigate the documentation.

**Reduced Support Costs:** Well-documented APIs require less explanation and troubleshooting, freeing up developer resources.

**Faster Onboarding:** New team members and external developers can learn the API quickly thanks to clear and consistent explanations alongside examples to jumpstart the process.

**Branding and Professionalism:** Polished documentation reflects positively on your organization, your commitment to your API, and your internal development practices.

**Enhanced Internal Collaboration:** Consistent documentation fosters a shared understanding within the development team and helps the onboarding of new team members that will be working on the API team.

## What to Include in Your Documentation Guidelines

Now that we understand the importance of documentation guidelines, let's explore what elements to incorporate into your style guide:

### **Content Standards:**

**Clarity and Conciseness:** Emphasize the importance of clear, unambiguous language, avoiding technical jargon, abbreviations, and internal team names or system names.

**Target Audience:** Consider the variety of roles for your intended audience (developers, operations, decision makers, etc.) and tailor the content to address each level of detail accordingly.

**Consistency:** Define standards for terminology, tone, and voice, ensuring a consistent style throughout the documentation.

### **Structure and Organization:**

**Hierarchy:** Outline a logical hierarchy for organizing information, starting with setting the context/purpose of the API, what it does/doesn’t do, then the more technical elements such as resources and operation details.

**Formatting:** Specify formatting conventions for headers, code snippets, tables, and links. This will provide polish and a sense of professionalism rather than an ad-hoc style that looks like it was thrown together a few minutes before it was released. 

**Navigation:** Ensure clear and consistent navigation within the documentation, allowing users to easily find what they need. This may not be a concern on day 1, but over time your documentation will grow and your navigation will need to be reevaluated through a lens of information architecture and user journeys. 

### **Content Requirements:**

**Minimal Documentation:** Define the minimum set of information required for each API endpoint (e.g., description, request parameters, response structure, example property values).

**Optional Content:** Outline additional information that can be included for more complex APIs (e.g., examples, authentication details, best practices). In some cases, this content can be shared across multiple APIs, but they should be referenced and linked within the documentation. 

### **Versioning and Change Management:**

**Changelogs:** Specify the format and location for change logs, documenting updates and API revisions.

**Versioning of Documentation:** Outline how documentation is versioned alongside the API itself, ensuring users access the correct documentation for their API version. This may include using the most recent version as the default documentation set, along with links to previous versions for those that haven’t migrated to the latest version yet. 

### **Style and Tone:**

**Voice and Tone:** Define the voice and tone of the documentation (e.g., formal, informal, helpful).

**Code Examples:** Specify the formatting and commenting conventions for code samples.

**Code Snippets and Examples:**

**Programming Language**: Define the programming language(s) used in code snippets for consistency.

**Error Handling:** Include examples of how to handle different error responses, such as reaching a rate limit and when to refresh an API token.

### **Tooling and Resources:**

**Recommended Tools:** Suggest tools that can be used to generate and manage API documentation (e.g., Swagger, OpenAPI). This may include adding the API to an internal API catalog and/or external API marketplace. 

**Links and References:** Provide a list of relevant resources, such as the official API style guide and external documentation standards, if available.

## Implementing Your Documentation Guidelines
Here are some tips for effectively implementing your documentation guidelines:

**Accessibility:** Ensure documentation is accessible to users with disabilities, following WCAG standards.

**Community Involvement:** Encourage feedback from developers and API consumers to continuously improve the documentation.

**Training and Resources:** Provide training sessions and resources to familiarize developers with the style guide.

**Style Guide Enforcement**: Utilize tools or checklists to ensure documentation adheres to the guidelines during the development process.

## 3. API Documentation
This section outlines the guidelines for documenting APIs within the organization.

### 3.1 Content Standards
Clarity and Conciseness: Documentation should be written in clear, concise, and unambiguous language. Avoid technical jargon whenever possible. Explain complex concepts in a way that is easy for the target audience to understand.
Target Audience: Identify the intended audience for the documentation (e.g., developers, operations team, system administrators). Tailor the level of detail and technical depth accordingly.
Consistency: Maintain a consistent style throughout the documentation in terms of terminology, tone, and voice. Define a glossary of terms to ensure consistent usage.

### 3.2 Structure and Organization

Hierarchy: Organize information logically, grouping related resources by functionality. Use a clear hierarchy with headings and subheadings to guide users.
Formatting: Specify consistent formatting conventions for elements like:
Headers (H1, H2, etc.)
Code snippets (including syntax highlighting and indentation)
Tables (including column headers and alignment)
Lists (bulleted and numbered)
Links (internal and external, including proper anchor text)
Navigation: Ensure easy navigation within the documentation. Utilize a table of contents, breadcrumbs, and clear links to allow users to find specific information quickly.

### 3.3 Content Requirements

Minimal Documentation: Define the minimum set of information required for each API endpoint. This typically includes:
A clear and concise description of the endpoint's purpose.
A list of request parameters, including their data type, format, and whether they are required or optional.
The expected response structure, including data types and descriptions of response fields.
Error codes and their corresponding meanings.
