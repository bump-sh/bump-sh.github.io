A great developer experience starts with API documentation. Delivering great API documentation requires teams to maintain accuracy, consistency, and efficiency not only for the first release, but for every subsequent release. This can be difficult with the fast-paced development cycles of modern software teams. The [Docs as Code](https://www.writethedocs.org/guide/docs-as-code/) approach has emerged as a powerful methodology that aligns documentation processes with software development workflows, treating documentation as a first-class citizen in the development lifecycle. Let’s explore what it is, how it works, and how you can get started. 

## What is Docs as Code?

Docs as Code applies software development best practices—such as version control, automated testing, and continuous integration—to documentation. This approach enables technical writers and developers to collaborate more effectively, ensuring that API documentation remains up-to-date, consistent, and of high quality. For large organizations with multiple teams and shared technical writers, Docs as Code offers a structured framework to blend developer-generated documentation and improvements and additional documentation produced by technical writers. 

## Continuous Delivery Principles for Docs

Applying continuous delivery principles to documentation brings numerous advantages, such as improved collaboration, automation, and version control. Below are the key components that drive the Docs as Code methodology.

### Version Control

Version control systems, such as [Git](https://git-scm.com/), provide a structured way to track changes in documentation. By managing documentation in a repository alongside the codebase, teams can:

- Maintain a historical record of changes
- Revert to previous versions when necessary
- Enable concurrent editing and review processes
- Facilitate branching and merging to manage documentation updates

This version-controlled approach ensures that documentation evolves alongside the API, reducing the risk of outdated or inconsistent information.

### Automated Doc Testing

Automated testing is a key aspect of ensuring documentation quality. While commonly associated with software testing, it can also be applied to technical documentation through:
- **Linting tools** (e.g., [Vale](https://vale.sh/), [Markdownlint](https://github.com/DavidAnson/markdownlint)) to enforce style guides and formatting consistency
- **Link checkers** to validate internal and external links
- **Schema validation tools** to ensure API documentation aligns with actual API definitions
- **Spell checkers and grammar checkers** to catch errors before publication
- **OpenAPI linters** (e.g., [vacuum](https://bump.sh/blog/api-linting-with-vacuum)) to enforce compliance with your organization’s API style guide. 

By automating quality control, documentation teams can catch issues early in the writing process and reduce manual proofreading efforts.

### Continuous Integration

Continuous integration (CI) practices for documentation involve automatically building and validating content whenever changes are committed. Popular CI/CD tools like GitHub Actions, GitLab CI, and Jenkins can be configured to:
- Run tests and linters on new commits
- Generate preview builds for review before merging
- Notify stakeholders of issues through automated reports

This ensures that documentation updates go through the same rigorous review process as code, enhancing reliability and consistency.

### Continuous Deployment

Continuous deployment (CD) enables teams to publish documentation automatically when changes are merged. By integrating documentation pipelines with an API documentation platform (e.g., [Bump.sh](https://bump.sh)), organizations can:
- Deliver real-time updates to developers
- Reduce the lag between API changes and documentation updates
- Ensure that published content is always in sync with the latest version of the API

Automating deployment removes bottlenecks in the publishing process and empowers developers to access up-to-date documentation instantly.

## The Impact of Docs as Code on Documentation Quality

Implementing Docs as Code practices has a direct impact on documentation quality, benefiting both technical writers and developers. Below are some of the key improvements:

### Increased Accuracy and Consistency

By treating documentation as code, organizations can ensure that API documentation is version-controlled and aligned with actual API changes. Automated validation tools help enforce consistency, making documentation more reliable and reducing discrepancies.

### Improved Collaboration and Communication

Docs as Code fosters a collaborative workflow where both developers and technical writers contribute to documentation in a shared repository. By leveraging pull requests, code reviews, and comments, teams can:
- Provide feedback in a structured manner
- Enforce quality standards through automated checks
- Ensure transparency in documentation changes

Leveraging [OpenAPI overlays for your API reference documentation](https://docs.bump.sh/guides/openapi/augmenting-generated-openapi/) helps technical writers to enrich default documentation, without disrupting developer flow. This collaborative approach bridges the gap between developers and technical writers, leading to more comprehensive and developer-friendly documentation.


### Faster and More Efficient Updates

With automated testing, continuous integration, and streamlined review processes, documentation updates can be implemented and deployed faster. This agility is crucial in API development, where rapid iterations and frequent releases require documentation to keep pace with evolving features.

### Easier to Maintain and Scale

Large organizations managing multiple APIs can benefit from the scalability of Docs as Code. Standardized workflows, automation, and modular documentation structures enable teams to:
- Reuse content across different API versions
- Maintain consistent formatting and style across documentation sets
- Reduce the overhead of manual updates and reviews

As the API landscape grows, a Docs as Code approach ensures that documentation remains manageable, maintainable, and scalable.

## Practical Tips and Best Practices

Anne Gentle has been a prominent advocate of the Docs as Code movement. Her book, [*Docs Like Code*](https://www.docslikecode.com/book/), outlines the principles and practices that organizations can adopt to integrate documentation into their software development workflows. She offers some terrific tips and best practices for applying Docs as Code into an approachable, repeatable process:

- Define a **documentation style guide** and enforce it with linting tools.
- Create **templates** for consistent documentation structure.
- Implement **automated link checking** to prevent broken links.
- Establish a **review workflow** with pull requests and approvals.
- Encourage **developer participation** through documentation sprints and contributions.

By following these best practices, organizations can create a sustainable Docs as Code ecosystem that supports high-quality documentation at scale.

## Conclusion

The Docs as Code approach transforms API documentation by aligning it with modern software development practices. By leveraging version control, automation, continuous integration, and deployment, organizations can:

- Enhance documentation accuracy and consistency
- Improve collaboration between developers and technical writers
- Accelerate documentation updates to match API changes
- Simplify maintenance and scalability across multiple teams

For technical writers and developers responsible for API documentation, adopting a Docs as Code workflow is not just an option—it’s a necessity for keeping up with the rapid pace of API development. By embracing these principles, organizations can ensure that their documentation remains an integral and valuable part of the API ecosystem.
