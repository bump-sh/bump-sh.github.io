Feedback from real-life users is the best way to improve your documentation. Our last update got you covered! 
Say hi to the new "Give feedback" button, designed to stand out from the rest of the topbar.

It can be added through a new vendor extension: `x-feedbackLink`, directly in the `info` object of your API definition file. 

The `x-feedbackLink`is an object composed of two elements: 
- the `url` string, redirecting to any URL, or any email using `mailto`,
- the `label` string to override the default "Give feedback" label.

By providing you with a free link, we want to give you the freedom to choose the type of feedback you want:
- A pre-filled issue in your GitHub repository using a template,
- A nicely designed form, 
- An email to the support team, ...

As always, don't hesitate to let us know what you think of this feature! You can even use our "feedback" button on our dashboard!
