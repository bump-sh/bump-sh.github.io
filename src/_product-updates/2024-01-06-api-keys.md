The API key, also known as a token, grants access to our API and allows you to integrate it into your continuous integration workflows. So far, it was working at the scale of a specific hub or a documentation.

We are evolving API keys so that they can now operate at the organization global level and everything it contains.
This change aims not only to greatly simplify the use of our API but also lays the groundwork for upcoming features, such as user management or the creation of documentation/hubs/etc...

For this migration of API keys, we made sure not to touch the existing ones to allow your existing workflows to continue functioning without any issues.
