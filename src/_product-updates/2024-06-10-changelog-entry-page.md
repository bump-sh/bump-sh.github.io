We have recently improved the changelog to make it easier to share updates to your API documentation.

In addition to the continuous deployment flow of the changelog, you can now click on each entry to view an individual page for a specific change. This option allows you to easily share a link directly pointing to the changes you don't want your API consumers to miss, whether they are members of your organization or partners.

Our API documentation allows you to easily test the rendering of these new pages, as shown with [this example](https://developers.bump.sh/changes/2bedfeb6).

We have many more updates coming to the changelog this year, and we can't wait to show them to you.
