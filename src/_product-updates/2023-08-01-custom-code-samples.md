We now support the `x-codeSamples` extension that let you set language-specific code samples you expect your users to work with.

Examples are often the first stop for developers in any API documentation. This extension allows you to set along a programming language, its custom code samples, for a more seamless developer experience when it comes to testing an API.

Either supercharge your API documentation by setting language-specific code examples or keep things simple as the auto-generated cURL examples remain. See more about custom code sample [in the docs](/help/doc-code-samples/).
