As part of our feature series on Release Management, making a change release editable was the obvious "go the extra mile" effort, while allowing you to further manipulate a change to be announced.

Custom title and description allow you to provide additional context that may not be apparent in an automatic diff summary. You can now explain why a change was made, not just what changed.

Detailed release notes can serve as a form of documentation, helping both current and future developers understand the history and evolution of an API.
