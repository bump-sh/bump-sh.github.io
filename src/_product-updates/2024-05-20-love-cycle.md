Looking for a comprehensive file listing all the APIs inside your hub? We’ve got you covered! 

We supports APIs.json, to automatically generate a JSON file out of your hub content. 

To access the JSON, simply add ```/apis.json``` at the end of your hub URL. It contains the description, type, version, documentation URL, and more about each API. 

[You can try it out on our hub here →](https://demo.bump.sh/apis.json)
