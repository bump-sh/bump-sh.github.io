Gain greater control over your API Documentation deployments by using the Manual Release Mode for your API documentation.

**Grouped changes:** Multiple changes are sometimes part of a single feature or improvement. Using this mode allows for these changes to be grouped together under a single changelog entry.

**Timing:** Keep merging your PRs and following your API changes on a daily basis, but control when you and your team communicate these changes to you API users.

**Quality Assurance:** Add an extra layer of QA and collaboration before a change is officially published.
