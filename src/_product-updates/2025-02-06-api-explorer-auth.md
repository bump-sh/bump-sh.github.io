Authentication is now supported for APIs providing authentication methods. 

We currently support:
- HTTP: Bearer/Basic, 
- API keys: Header/Query string/Cookie, 
- OAuth2: basic support through a header token field.

Users only have to define it once to use it on any of your API operations that require it.
