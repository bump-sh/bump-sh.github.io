Authentication is often a prerequisite for using an API. Our API Explorer now supports it!

We currently support:
- HTTP: Bearer/Basic, 
- API keys: Header/Query string/Cookie, 
- OAuth2: basic support through a header token field.

Users only have to define it once to use it on any of your API operations that require it. They can also combine multiple authentication methods when the API requires it.

The API Explorer is still in beta. We warmly welcome your feedback!
