The changelog allows the consumers of your API documentation to track changes as your documentation evolves. We have recently improved it with several new features, such as the [changelog diff](https://docs.bump.sh/product-updates/2023/11/02/changelog-diff/) to track for example the differences between two changes.

Today, we are adding a new feature to the changelog: individual pages for each change in your documentation. Each release of your documentation generates a new entry in the changelog that now has its own page and unique URL. This allows you to easily share a link directly pointing to specific changes with members of your organization or your ecosystem.
You can also document or provide context to these changes with Markdown support, directly in your definition file.

This new feature also allows you to better track your pending releases if you have chosen to enable [Manual Release](https://docs.bump.sh/product-updates/2023/09/28/manual-release/) on your documentation. You can click on a pending release to see exactly its associated changelog entry and facilitate their management.
