Since its release in the summer of 2022, our Search Engine has quickly become very popular for your searches across your documentation and hubs. However, we didn't plan to stop at this initial iteration.
We have completely reworked the Search Engine algorithm to make searches even faster, especially across your hubs.

Overall, the search speed has been increased by a factor of 10. And in certain situations, particularly for organizations with numerous hubs and documentations, the search is now up to 20 times faster.
