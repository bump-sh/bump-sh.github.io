Organizations are great when you need to work collaboratively with your team. Instead of a single shared account, each member of your team will be able to access/maintain your documentation and hubs.

Organizations are also super useful if you want to invite guests (who are called "viewers") to your documentation: it's a read-only role. If you need to keep your API private or shared with a small number of partners, viewers are a great solution.
