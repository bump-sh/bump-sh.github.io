Organizations are great when you need to work collaboratively with your team. Instead of a single shared account, each member of your team will be able to access/maintain your documentation and hubs.

We designed Organization to be the place where a team meets their API documentation, within the same workspace with specific roles and rules.

Organizations have their own structure and settings, apart from your personal account. You can switch between them using the dropdown menu, in the top bar.
