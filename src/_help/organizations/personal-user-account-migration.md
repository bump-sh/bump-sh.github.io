Since the launch of Bump.sh, we've noticed that the approach we initially chose was no longer suited to our users. Indeed, they heavily utilize Bump.sh collaboratively.

To accommodate this evolution and prepare for future features, we've decided to transform personal user accounts into organizations.

## Why this change?

Initially, Bump.sh was first designed around individual usage before gradually shifting towards team collaboration. However, it's this latter need that has become widely predominant.

We observed that personal user accounts sometimes caused confusion, especially for users signing up to join an organization. Conversely, some personal projects could grow enough to transition to team collaboration.

## What does this change mean for me?

For our new users, the change mainly occurs during registration, where you'll be asked to create your organization. You'll enjoy all the features of organizations during your free trial. At the end of it, you can choose to continue benefiting from the full potential of organizations or switch to a free plan.

For our existing users, we've made some significant changes regarding your personal user account.
If you hadn't used your personal user account, nothing changes: you're still associated with your usual organizations.

If you had hubs and documentations in your personal user account:

- A new organization has been created, adopting your slug/username.
- All your hubs and documentation have been migrated to this organization.
- Your existing URLs remain the same and still work; we haven't touched them at all.

## What impact should you expect on pricing?

Previously, organizations were a feature reserved for our paid plans. To accommodate this transition, users on a Free plan now have access to an organization, which includes only public access documentation.

All other organization features (such as access management, invitations, collaborative work) remain reserved for our paid plans.
