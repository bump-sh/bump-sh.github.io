Publishing your first API documentation on Bump.sh will only take you a few moments. Creating an account, documentation, and uploading your first API definition can be done in just a few clicks.

## Create your Bump.sh account

The very first step is to create your Bump.sh account.

Two options are available: using your email address and creating a username, or through your GitHub account.

Pay attention when choosing your username: it will act as a slug to access your API documentation and will appear in the URL (unless you configure a custom domain later). You can change this username/slug later on.

## Create your first documentation

### Step 1: Create your documentation

Now that your Bump.sh account is created, you will immediately be prompted to create your first API documentation.

As mentioned earlier, you will find your username in its URL. Choose a name and define whether this documentation should be public or private. Feel free to check the dedicated help page to learn more about our access management options.

### Step 2: Upload your file

Once the documentation is created, all that's left is to upload your first API definition. You can also use our CLI or use one of the provided examples to get started with Bump.sh.
