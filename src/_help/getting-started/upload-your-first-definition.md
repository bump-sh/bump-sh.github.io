## Create your first documentation

### Step 1: Create your space/documentation

After creating your account, you'll be asked [to create and name](https://bump.sh/docs/new?utm_source=bump&utm_medium=content_hub&utm_campaign=getting_started) your first API documentation.
By default, your documentation URL will use the same name: you can customize it in the slug field. You can also use [custom domains](/help/custom-domains), which we'll explain later.

### Step 2: Upload your file

If you already have a specification file, you can immediately upload it.
You can also use our examples to see Bump.sh in action. Finally, our [CLI](/help/bump-cli) can also be directly used to jump in.

### Step 3: Enjoy

Generating your first documentation will take a few seconds. But let's not stop here: many features are awaiting to customize and make the most of your API documentation. Let's have a look in the next section.


## Publish your documentation

Congratulations on releasing your first API documentation on Bump.sh!

One of the first things you may have in mind is how to share your documentation with the world, your team or keep it for yourself.
Bump.sh offers several options to manage access to your documentation.
During the onboarding, you may have noticed the option of making your doc public or private.

Public documentation are available to anyone with the URL or if the search engine indexation has been activated.
Private ones are only accessible to you (or your team/organization if you have one).

We share more details on the [Access Management page](/help/access-management).
