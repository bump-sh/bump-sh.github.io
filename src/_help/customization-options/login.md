[Organizations](/help/organizations/) using one or more [SSO connections](/help/organizations/organization-access-management/#sso) for access to their documentation and hubs can customize the SSO login page.

It is possible to display their logo but also to customize the connection buttons and their description (adding text to them).
These customization options are available upon request.
