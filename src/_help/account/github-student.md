The [GitHub Student Developer Pack](https://education.github.com/pack?sort=popularity&tag=Infrastructure+%26+APIs) is a collection of tools available for free to eligible students, enabling them to try out professional tools that would otherwise be financially out of reach.

[Bump.sh](http://bump.sh/) is incredibly proud to be a part of this offering. We have been students too and understand the importance of good documentation for your academic or personal projects.

To benefit from this, you must be an eligible student (see conditions on GitHub) and use your GitHub account to sign up to [Bump.sh](http://bump.sh/). You can enjoy your [Bump.sh](http://bump.sh/) subscription for free as long as you are recognized as a student on your GitHub account.

The GitHub Student Pack provides access to all the features of the Standard plan on Bump.sh.

To learn more about our inclusion in the GitHub Student Developer Pack, you can check out [our blog post](https://bump.sh/blog/Bump-included-in-the-github-student-developer-pack).

## FAQ

- I've already created my account on [Bump.sh](http://bump.sh/) before taking advantage of the GitHub Student Developer Pack: can I link it? Unfortunately, no: your [Bump.sh](http://bump.sh/) account must be created through the dedicated page on GitHub to activate the offer.

- What happens when I'm no longer a student? No worries: we won't delete your API documentation. However, your account will be switched to the free plan, and you'll lose access to the premium features of [Bump.sh](http://bump.sh/). If you had private documentation, it won't be accessible until you switch to a paid plan.
