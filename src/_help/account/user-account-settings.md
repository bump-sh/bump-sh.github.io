## Delete your account

If necessary, you can initiate the deletion of your Bump.sh account from this section. Deleting your account will result in the removal of all data related to you: documentation, hubs, etc...

> This option is irreversible: we cannot restore the deleted content, even upon request.
> Your data is truly erased from our servers once this request is validated on your end: it is NOT a soft-delete.
