API documentation deserves a bit more writing. It can be useful to add an introduction or a quick tutorial. You might want to provide context, additional reading or understanding materials.

To help you enrich your API documentation, Bump.sh supports [Markdown](/help/enhance-documentation-content/markdown-support/), offering better formatting and the ability to add your own images.

We also offer [topics](/help/enhance-documentation-content/topics/): an exclusive custom property that allows you to add extra information to your documentation.
