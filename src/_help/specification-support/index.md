Bump.sh supports the most popular specifications for REST and Event-Driven APIs.

- [OpenAPI Specification](/help/specification-support/openapi-support)
- [AsyncAPI Specification](/help/specification-support/asyncapi-support)

We do plan to support more specifications in the future. If there is one specifically you're looking for, feel free to <a class="intercom-launcher-selector" href="mailto:help@bump.sh">contact us</a>!
