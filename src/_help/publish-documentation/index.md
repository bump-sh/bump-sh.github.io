Publishing documentation is the step between your API definition and human-readable documentation.

Bump.sh offers various tools to simplify this process.

Deploying your API definition files can be done in several ways, through our website, API, or by integrating with your CI pipeline. You can choose between automatic deployments or manual validation to have more control over the published content or share work-in-progress variants with your team.

This section also covers the concept of branching, which allows you to have multiple versions of an API (such as v1.0/v2.0 or production and staging).

Finally, Access Management details the different levels of accessibility for your documentation and how to secure access to it.
