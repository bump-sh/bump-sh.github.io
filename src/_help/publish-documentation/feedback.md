Gathering feedback directly from your users allows you to identify areas that need more explanation, thereby continuously improving the quality of your API documentation.

The `x-feedbackLink` object can be added in the `info` section of your API document, which will add a button to your documentation that directly links to the resource (URL) of your choice.
It requires two elements:
- `label`: the text that will appear on the button
- `url`: can point to a form, for example, or even an email address (using `mailto:`).

```yaml
info:
  x-feedbackLink:
    label: Share a feedback
    url: https://my-company.com/feedback
```
