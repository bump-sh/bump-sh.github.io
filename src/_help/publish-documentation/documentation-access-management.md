## Public or Private?

Bump.sh allows you to choose whether a documentation is public or private.

By "public," we mean documentation that is accessible to any visitor who has access to it, either by finding it through a direct link or through a search engine.
Public documentation is indexed by search engines and can be found by anyone without any restrictions. It is not possible to restrict access to any part of your documentation; it will be fully accessible.

Private documentation, on the other hand, is only accessible to users who have been individually invited. There are two types of invited users: those who are part of the same organization and "external" guests.
When documentation is set as private, it is completely private. It is excluded from indexing by search engines, and only authenticated users who know its URL can access it.

## Private

### Invite external guests

To invite people to access a private documentation, click on the `Share Access` button, which is visible in the settings of that documentation.

From there, you just need to enter the email address of the invited person.

They will receive an email inviting them to sign up on Bump.sh. This step is essential to ensure the security of access to your documentation.

### Invite members of an organization

Inviting a colleague or teammate to become a member of [your organization](/help/organizations/) can be done from the settings of that organization. Simply enter the email address of the person in question.

## Public

Access to your public documentations is solely determined by its URL and its discoverability by search engines.

Your public documentations are accessible at the URL `https://bump.sh/your-slug/your-documentation`.

> Any changes to your slug/username will result in a change in the URL of your public documentations, without redirection from our side. Make sure to update the URLs you publish or share with your API users accordingly.
