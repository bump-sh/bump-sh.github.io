## What is a hub

Hubs are a feature available starting from our paid plans: they allow you to manage collections of API documentation simply and efficiently.

With hubs, your API ecosystem is displayed on a single page, where documentation can be sorted by categories.

Hubs also provide a unified changelog, making it easy to identify all changes across all the documentation it contains at a glance. Search is also global, allowing you to search across all documentation.

Next step: [Create your first hub](/hubs/create-and-manage-hubs).
