## What is a hub

Hubs allow you to manage collections of API documentation simply and efficiently.

With hubs, your API ecosystem is displayed on a single page, where documentation can be sorted by categories.

Hubs also provide a unified changelog, making it easy to identify all changes across all the documentation it contains at a glance. Search is also global, allowing you to search across all documentation.

> Hubs are available from our paid plans.
