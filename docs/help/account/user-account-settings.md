Accessible from the Dashboard, the Account Settings page allows you to quickly modify certain elements related to your account.

From this page, you can modify:

- your first and last name
- your password
- your username

# Modify Username

Your username serves also as your slug, which is part of the URL of your documentation and hubs except if you use custom domains.
Modify your username will impact your URLs

# Delete your account

If necessary, you can initiate the deletion of your Bump.sh account from this section. Deleting your account will result in the removal of all data related to you: documentation, hubs, etc...

This option is irreversible, and no reversal is possible: we cannot restore the deleted content, even upon request.

# Organization Tab

The Organizations tab shows the list of organizations your account has access to, along with their settings if you are an admin. New organizations can also be created from this section.
