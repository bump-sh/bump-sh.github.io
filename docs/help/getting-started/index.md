# Getting started with Bump.sh

Bump.sh connects people with REST and event-driven APIs, by centralizing a reference point: their documentation, highlighted with the latest changes and updates. Customize their look and feel, manage who can access (read or maintain) which doc.

From OpenAPI and AsyncAPI specifications, Bump.sh generates the documentation you need and offers many options to make it your custom and carefully crafted API experience. Those specifications are also supported by a wide variety of frameworks in various programming languages, which generate contract files automatically. 

Our guides below will help you locate and use those files to deploy your API docs on Bump.sh:

- [Quick start with specification files](getting-started/quick-start) if you work directly with an OpenAPI or AsyncAPI file.
- [Quick start with API Platform](getting-started/api-platform) if you are building an API with API Platform (PHP).
- [Quick start with FastAPI](getting-started/fastapi) if you are building an API with FastAPI (Python).
