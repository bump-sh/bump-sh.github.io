Bump allows you to easily generate your API documentation and API changelog.

From an [OpenAPI](undefined) or [AsyncAPI](undefined) specification, you can deploy your **API documentation in a couple of minutes**. You can customize your documentation UI (title, colors, menu), protect it with a password, and customize its URL with [your own domain](undefined).

Share a link to your documentation with your API consumers and help them to never miss an API change again. Indeed, they will have the possibility to **track API structural changes** if they subscribe by email. Once a week, subscribers will receive a changelog digest of your documentation if your API has changed. Curious? Here is the API [documentation changelog](https://developers.bump.sh/changes) of our own API.

To make the most out of Bump, we suggest to integrating our tool in your development process. We offer a [Command Line Interface](undefined) and [Continuous Integration](undefined) examples to let you: view API diff during code review thanks to our [Github Action](undefined), Bump will automatically **comment your pull requests with changes digest**, then once merged we will **deploy your changes** directly to your documentation page.

If you work in a multiple services environment and have many different APIs, we got you covered. You can organize and mix your OpenAPI and AsyncAPI based documentations, in a [developer Hub](undefined). You will thus have **all of your APIs listed in one place**. Check our [demo “Train company” hub](https://demo.bump.sh/) for a live example.
